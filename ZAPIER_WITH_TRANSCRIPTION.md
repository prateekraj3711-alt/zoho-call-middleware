1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/) → Sign up (free)

2. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**

3. Connect your GitHub (or use "Deploy from URL"):
   - If using GitHub: Push the `zoho-call-tickets` folder to a repo
   - If no GitHub: Use "Public Git repository"

4. Configure:
   - **Name**: `zoho-call-middleware`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r middleware_requirements.txt`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Middleware Issues**

**"Middleware not responding"**
→ Check Render/Railway dashboard, ensure service is running

**"Failed to download recording"**
→ Verify Exotel credentials in middleware environment variables

**"Transcription failed"**
→ Check Deepgram API key, verify credits available

### **Zapier Issues**

**"No tickets created"**
→ Check Filter step, might be blocking all requests

**"Duplicate tickets"**
→ Middleware tracks processed calls, duplicates should be rare

**"Transcription note not added"**
→ Verify Zoho Desk permissions for adding comments

## 💰 Costs

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| **Render Free Tier** | $0/month (sleeps after 15min inactivity) |
| **Railway Free Tier** | $5 credit/month |
| **Zapier Free** | 100 tasks/month (20 calls max) |
| **Zapier Starter** | $29.99/month (750 tasks = 150 calls) |
| **Deepgram** | $0.0043/min (~$0.01 per 2min call) |
| **OpenAI** | ~$0.001 per analysis |

**Total for 100 calls/month:** ~$1-2 (Deepgram + OpenAI only if using free tiers)

## 🚀 Upgrade: Keep Middleware Awake

**Problem**: Render free tier sleeps after 15min inactivity  
**Solution**: Add a keep-alive ping

### **Option 1: Add to Zapier (Simple)**

1. Add another Zap:
   - **Trigger**: Schedule → Every 10 minutes
   - **Action**: Webhooks → GET
   - **URL**: `https://your-middleware.onrender.com/health`

### **Option 2: Use Uptime Robot (Free)**

1. Go to [UptimeRobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com/)
2. Add new monitor:
   - **Type**: HTTP(s)
   - **URL**: `https://your-middleware.onrender.com/health`
   - **Interval**: 5 minutes
